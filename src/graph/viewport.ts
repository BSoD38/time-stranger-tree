/**
 * Compact an open route into a clean staircase. Like compactFocus, this exists

 *
 * The nodes are sequenced along the spread axis in route order (evenly spaced),
 * while the generation axis carries their generation LEVEL — the distinct
 * generations the route visits, re-indexed to consecutive bands (collapsing the
 * full graph's tier gaps, as compactFocus does). So a digivolve reads as a step
 * up a band and a de-digivolve as a step down, consistent with the generation
 * axis everywhere else. A route is a loopless path, so the spread coordinate
 * increases monotonically and the glowing links never cross — no
 * crossing-reduction pass is needed (unlike the branching focus lineage).
 * Only the route's own nodes move; everything else is hidden in this mode.

 * spread order within a band; there's no lineage to run a crossing pass over.
